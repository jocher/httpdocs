Adds a shortcode for displaying any native WordPress Gallery as a responsive slider.

== Description ==

Just insert a gallery into the text editor and replace `[gallery (parameters)]` with `[flexslider (parameters)]`.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `flexslider-native-gallery` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where’s the options page? =

There is none. 

= Why not?? =

Because all you need is the core gallery feature in WordPress and a keyboard to override `[gallery]` with  `[flexslider]`.

= I don’t see the [gallery] shortcode anywhere! =

Use the “Text” tab in your editor (know as “HTML” prior to WordPress 3.5) and you’ll see it. You can switch back to “Visual” after you’ve edited the shortcode.

= What slider script is being used in the plugin? =
The FlexSlider jQuery plugin originally coded by Tyler Smith (@madebymuffin), now curated by WooThemes (http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/).

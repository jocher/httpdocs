FlexSlider Native Gallery
=========================

WooTheme’s responsive [FlexSlider](http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/) marries WordPress’s core gallery.

## Description

Adds a shortcode for displaying any native WordPress gallery as a responsive FlexSlider. Just insert a gallery into the text editor and replace `[gallery (parameters)]` with `[flexslider (parameters)]`.

## Installation

1. Upload the `flexslider-native-gallery` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where’s the options page?

There is none. 

### Why not??

Because all you need is the core gallery feature in WordPress and a keyboard to override `[gallery]` with  `[flexslider]`.

### I don’t see the [gallery] shortcode anywhere!

Use the “Text” tab in your editor (know as “HTML” prior to WordPress 3.5) and you’ll see it. You can switch back to “Visual” after you’ve edited the shortcode.

### What slider script is being used in the plugin?

The FlexSlider jQuery plugin originally coded by Tyler Smith (@madebymuffin), now curated by [WooThemes](http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/).

4. Insert a SlideDeck in your post or page by clicking on the "Embed a SlideDeck" button above the rich text editor in the post/page view.

You can also place a SlideDeck in your template or theme via the PHP command “do_shortcode()”. Just pass the ID of the SlideDeck you want to render. For example:
`<?php echo do_shortcode( "[SlideDeck2 id=1644]" ); ?>`
